## Manual script to install Stratux ADS-B sources, build tools and prereqs on a fresh Raspian Strech SD light edition image 
## Tested with Stratux V1.5b2
## I do this on a Rpi3 so I can use the hardwired ethernet connection for the downloads instead of first having to setup WiFi since that is going to be used as accesspoint by Stratux
## I use a USB keyboard and a HDMI monitor instead of remote SSH, If using SSH it must be first enabled via raspi-config
## after build the so prepared SD card can then be moved to a Rpi-Zero-W and it will run like on the Rpi3 
## -- Only exception is a slight delay in the bootprocess becasue the Zero doesn't have a hardwired ethernet port and the dhcp client times out 

## HOWEVER:!!  The pi-zero-w is producing a lot more noise in the 118-136mhz range compared to the pi3. It seems to radiate from the USB connection as well as from 
##             the UART cable. When connecting the SDR's via hub or USB cable the noise footprint is geting stronger.  I found it unusable in the airplane as the noise interference 
##             blocks out com frequencies. For that reason I went back to a pi3 with wifi.



##	expanding root file system is not necessary on strech -- done automatically on first boot

login to user pi
sudo raspi_config 	## to get the time zone, local and keyborad correct
sudo su
sudo apt-get update
//sudo apt-get upgrade
apt-get install git
apt-get install cmake
apt-get install vim  		## for color coded vi -- not strictly necessary
apt-get install libusb-1.0  #needed to get libusb-1.0-0-dev for building  librtlsdr next
## copy librtlsdr from git at https://github.com/jpoirier/librtlsdr to user/home directory 
git clone https://github.com/jpoirier/librtlsdr 
## follow instructions in README.md but use cmake ../ -DINSTALL_UDEV_RULES=ON instead of plain cmake
## check that librtlsdr.so is in /usr/lical/lib/ amongst others
## check that /etc/udev/rules.d has file rtl-sdr.rules
exit su by Crtl D
cd ~		// should be at /home/pi now 

## install golang
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.12.5.linux-armv6l.tar.gz		## takes a while , 101 Mb
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.12.5.linux-armv6l.tar.gz					## takes a while
## edit ~/.bshrc to add the path for the go tools
vi or nano -- add to end of file:
 export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
 export GOROOT="/usr/local/go"
 export CGO_CFLAGS_ALLOW=-L/home/pi/stratux		## i.e. the directory where stratux sources are going to be
logout - login to get new env vars set -- or source .bashrc
git clone https://github.com/cyoung/stratux
cd ~/stratux
cp image/stxAliases.txt ~/			## use "source stxAliases.txt" from your home directory for some handy debug alieas 


## wiringPi is rquired for fancontrol build target. However WiringPi no longers supports static linking and therefore fancontrol can not be built with
## the WiringPi that is available from the provided github link.  -- Cyoung must have an old copy scrolled away that is not part of his github 
## therefore comment out all instances of fancontrol in Makefile (5 instances) using vi or nano , cd ~/stratux ; vi Makefile 
sudo service stratux stop		## should not be necessary on a fresh SD card, but needed should stratux be running already 
make			## takes long! There are some messages about "No names found, cannot describe anything" --seems not to be an issue 
				## takes about 10 minutes on Rpi3 -- No progress report on the main compile -- don't kill 

sudo mkdir /var/www
sudo chmod a+w /var/www

make Install 

## Configuring the WiFi acesspoint and DHCP server
sudo apt-get install dnsmasq
sudo apt-get install hostapd
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/garystofer/StratuxSDConfig
copy all the files from folder StratuxSDConfig/etc to /etc -- i.e.:
								/etc/dhcpcd.con, /etc/dnsmasq.conf, /etc/motd, /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf,
								/etc/networ/interfaces, /etc/default/hostapd, /etc/modprobe.d/rtl-sdr-blacklist.conf
 
## start the wifi host access point 
sudo systemctl unmask hostapd
sudo systemctl enable hostapd
sudo systemctl start hostapd
edit with vi or nano the file /etc/rc.local and add the following before the line "exit 0" :
	/usr/sbin/logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf
sudo reboot	

## check with tablet or phone that the WiFi accesspoint named Stratux appears and that the device can get an IP adress from the DHCP server  dnsmasq 
## file /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf holds the SSID and encrytion mode specifics of the accesspoint, change to your desire 

## workaround for dnsmasq DHCP server used in Strech instead of isc-dhcp-server used in Jesse:
sudo touch /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases	## create empty file -- so that v1.52b2 code doesnt abort scan for connected client
sudo vi /etc/stratux-static-hosts.conf  ## add the IP address and name of your device that wants to connecting via the app interface at port 4000, i.e.
										## If a different device needs to connect it's IP address and name has to be added to the file 
										## assigned IP address and hostname can be found in file /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases
## IP address - space - Hostname newline
"
192.168.10.12 Galaxy_Tab_A
				
"	

## finally start the stratux service 
sudo service stratux start
sudo reboot

## connect tablet and check out the stratux web interface 
## the WiFi SSID of the device can be changed in the file /etc/hostpad/hostapd.conf

Connect tablet to the WiFIi SSID of stratux -- It should say "Connected, no Internet"
start a webbrowser and point it at http://192.168.10.1 -- the Startux web interface should come up 


## in case of Serial GPS only:
## on Pi3 and Pi ZeroW enable the UART back to /dev/tyyAMA0  so it can be used by a RS232 GPS receiver
## disable the use of the hardware UART used by the BT device 
sudo rasopi-config ## go to 5.) Interfacing options; then Serial and say No to Shell over serial and yes to Enable serial port
cd /boot
sudo vi config.txt ; add "dtoverlay=pi3-disable-bt" to end of file
sudo systemctl disable hciuart
sudo vi /boot/cmdline.txt
Step 2:  Find the following text and remove it: console=tty0
sudo reboot


## To limit the stratux.log file to a size not to exceed do the following
sudo vi /etc/logrotate.d/stratux
## add the following to the file:
"
/var/log/stratux.log {
	rotate 2
	size 100k
}
"
## this rotates the log file 2 times as soon as the file size exeeds 100k -- Do this for other log files you whisch to keep small as well.
## logrotate runs at startup and multiple times during the day but not often enough to immediatly truncate a file when size goes beyound

## adding a shutdown switch to GPIO26, connect a switch between gpio and gnd to turn the device off  gracefully
#edit file /boot/config.txt to add the following
dtoverlay=gpio-shutdown,gpio_pin=26 ## use the reset pins to restart the pi after shutdown or interrupt power to the device.
## or
dtoverlay=gpio-shutdown,gpio_pin=3 ## shutdown AND restart on GPIO03 
dtoverlay=act_led_gpio=4		   ## reroutes the blinking led to GPIO04 for remote monitoring

## to disable almost all logging to logfiles, do the following from the command line
sudo service rsyslog stop
sudo systemctl disable rsyslog

## see rest of config.txt in folder /boot
